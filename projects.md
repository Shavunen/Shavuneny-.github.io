# Computer Science Projects

### Giants and Ogres Project 
I created a program where an ogre and giant fought against eachother to the death. This program was written in Java. The most challenging aspect of this program was creating the monster class that classified the attributes of each monster type. This project repo can be found [here](https://github.com/Shavunen/Giants-and-Ogres-)

### Animal Picker Project
I created this program where a user can input an animal and the ASCII art creation of that animal is shown to the user. This program was written in Java. The most challenging aspect of this program was keeping track of the nested loops that generated the ASCII art. This project repo can be found [here](https://github.com/Shavunen/AnimalPicker1)
